# Simple Website
During demos, etc, often a very simple website is needed, with very simple directory layout (and limited set of files), to use with web servers, etc. Sometimes you want to show data copy operations between containers, pods, volumes and what not; and you always wonder: "What is the simplest set of files to use?". So, this repo is the answer. A very simple website, which contains just one index.html and one index.php file, (and a README.md). That's it. Enjoy!
